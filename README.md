This repository contains my exercises for university course of AiSD (Algorithms and Data Structures).

## Repository info

Every project is written in C++ standard 11 and uses Code::Blocks IDE.

The course was conducted in Polish language, so assignment descriptions in pdfs have Polish names.

Each exercise was completed in two weeks.
